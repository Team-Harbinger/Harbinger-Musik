### App Evaluation

- **Market:** Individuals who want to find and listen to music, curious about popular or trending releases.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wanted.
- **Scope:** Host the web app on GitHub Pages. If we continue to work on the app, we would add more social features like having a friends list, chatrooms, etc. We would also add other themes.
